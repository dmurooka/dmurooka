# Hi, I'm Daishin 👋  
Founder–Engineer focused on designing maintainable systems that model real-world businesses.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

### Pepperoni Booking — Founder & Lead Engineer
A multi-tenant SaaS booking platform for Pilates, Yoga, and Gyrotonic®/Gyrokinesis® studios.

I own the system architecture and core domain design, with an emphasis on maintainability, clear separation of responsibilities, and safe evolution as business requirements change.

The platform supports multiple studios with domain-specific workflows while minimizing coupling and operational complexity.

I am also hands-on with backend, frontend, and infrastructure to ensure architectural consistency throughout the end-to-end process.

I lead both artistic direction and business operations, while designing internal systems and processes to support long-term growth, staff development, and scalability.

## 🧠 What I Do
- Design and build products from 0 → production
- Architect scalable systems with explicit domain boundaries (multi-tenant SaaS, service-oriented design)

- Translate complex business operations into clear technical models
